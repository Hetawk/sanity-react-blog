can we check all our different codebase here and see if we are using vulnerable packages

based on this

A critical vulnerability in React Server Components (CVE-2025-55182) has been responsibly disclosed. It affects React 19 and frameworks that use it, including Next.js (CVE-2025-66478).
If you are using Next.js, every version between Next.js 15 and 16 is affected, and we recommend immediately updating to the latest Next.js versions containing the appropriate fixes (15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7).
If you are using another framework using Server Components, we also recommend immediately updating to the latest React versions containing the appropriate fixes (19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1).

Security Advisory: CVE-2025-66478

December 06, 9:05 PM PST: If your application was online and unpatched as of December 4th, 2025 at 1:00 PM PT, we strongly encourage you to rotate any secrets it uses, starting with your most critical ones.

December 06, 7:29 AM PST: An npm package has been released to update affected Next.js apps. Use npx fix-react2shell-next to update now, or visit the GitHub repository to learn more.

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the React Server Components (RSC) protocol. The issue is rated CVSS 10.0 and can allow remote code execution when processing attacker-controlled requests in unpatched environments.

This vulnerability originates in the upstream React implementation (CVE-2025-55182). This advisory (CVE-2025-66478) tracks the downstream impact on Next.js applications using the App Router.

Impact
The vulnerable RSC protocol allowed untrusted inputs to influence server-side execution behavior. Under specific conditions, an attacker could craft requests that trigger unintended server execution paths. This can result in remote code execution in unpatched environments.

All users should upgrade to a patched version immediately. See the required action section for specific instructions.

Affected Next.js Versions
Applications using React Server Components with the App Router are affected when running:

Next.js 15.x
Next.js 16.x
Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases
Next.js 13.x, Next.js 14.x stable, Pages Router applications, and the Edge Runtime are not affected.

Fixed Versions
The vulnerability is fully resolved in the following patched Next.js releases:

15.0.5
15.1.9
15.2.6
15.3.6
15.4.8
15.5.7
16.0.7
We also released patched canary releases for Next.js 15 and 16:

15.6.0-canary.58 (for 15.x canary releases)
16.1.0-canary.12 (for 16.x canary releases)
These versions include the hardened React Server Components implementation.

Required Action
All users should upgrade to the latest patched version in their release line:

Terminal
npm install next@15.0.5   # for 15.0.x
npm install next@15.1.9   # for 15.1.x
npm install next@15.2.6   # for 15.2.x
npm install next@15.3.6   # for 15.3.x
npm install next@15.4.8   # for 15.4.x
npm install next@15.5.7   # for 15.5.x
npm install next@16.0.7   # for 16.0.x
 
npm install next@15.6.0-canary.58   # for 15.x canary releases
npm install next@16.1.0-canary.12   # for 16.x canary releases
If you are on Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or a later canary release, downgrade to the latest stable 14.x release:

Terminal
npm install next@14
If you're currently using canary releases to enable PPR, you can update to 15.6.0-canary.58, which includes a fix for the vulnerability while continuing to support PPR. For other ways to patch older versions, see this discussion post.

Run npx fix-react2shell-next to launch an interactive tool which can check versions and perform deterministic version bumps per the recommended versions above. See the GitHub repository for full details.

Terminal
npx fix-react2shell-next
There is no workaround—upgrading to a patched version is required.

Rotating environment variables
Once you have patched your version and re-deployed your application, we recommend rotating all your application secrets. Learn about working with environment variables in the documentation here.
