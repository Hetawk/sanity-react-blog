# Skills & Experiences Section — Professional Redesign Proposal

> **Goal:** Transform the Skills & Experiences section into a compelling, professional showcase suitable for PhD applications and senior engineering positions.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Current Issues

- Basic skill icons without context or proficiency levels
- Generic experience timeline without detailed achievements
- Missing research experience and academic contributions
- No clear progression or storytelling
- Lacks visual hierarchy and professional polish

### New Approach

**"Show, Don't Just Tell"** — Every skill and experience should tell a story with:

- Proficiency indicators (years, projects, certifications)
- Tangible achievements and metrics
- Visual progression timeline
- Interactive elements for engagement
- Professional academic aesthetic
