# Complete Sanity Removal - Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully removed ALL Sanity dependencies from the portfolio application and migrated completely to the new MySQL-based API backend.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. **Frontend Container Components** (Public Facing)

✅ Updated all container components to use the new API instead of Sanity:

- **`src/container/About/About.jsx`** - Already using API ✓
- **`src/container/Work/Work.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API
- **`src/container/Skills/Skills.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API
- **`src/container/Awards/Awards.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API

**Changes Made:**

- Replaced `import { client, urlFor } from '../../client'` with `import api from '../../api/client'`
- Replaced `client.fetch(query)` with `api.works.getAll()`, `api.skills.getAll()`, etc.
- Replaced all `urlFor(image)` calls with direct `image` URLs
- Updated to use response structure: `response.data`

---

### 2. **Dashboard ContentManagers** (Admin Panel)

✅ Updated all Dashboard management components:

- **`WorksManager.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API
- **`AboutsManager.jsx`** - Already using API ✓
- **`SkillsManager.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API
- **`AwardsManager.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API
- **`ExperiencesManager.jsx`** - Migrated from Sanity to API

**Changes Made:**

- Replaced all Sanity client imports with API client
- Updated all `client.fetch()` calls to API methods
- Removed all `urlFor()` image URL transformations
- Changed `_id` references to `id` for consistency with MySQL

---

### 3. **File System Changes**

✅ Cleaned up Sanity-related files:

- **Moved:** `src/client.js` → `src/client.js.backup` (Sanity client file)
- **Uninstalled Packages:**
  - `@sanity/client` - Removed from package.json
  - `@sanity/image-url` - Removed from package.json

---

### 4. **Environment Variables**

✅ Removed from Vercel Production:

- ~~`REACT_APP_SANITY_TOKEN`~~ ❌ Deleted
- ~~`REACT_APP_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`~~ ❌ Deleted
- ~~`REACT_APP_SANITY_DATASET`~~ ❌ Deleted

✅ Updated Dashboard validation:

- Removed `REACT_APP_SANITY_TOKEN` check from `Dashboard.jsx`

---

### 5. **Code Pattern Changes**

#### Before (Sanity):

```javascript
import { client, urlFor } from "../../client";

// Fetch data
const query = '*[_type == "works"]';
client.fetch(query).then((data) => {
  setWorks(data);
});

// Display images
<img src={urlFor(work.imgUrl)} alt={work.title} />;
```

#### After (MySQL API):

```javascript
import api from "../../api/client";

// Fetch data
const fetchWorks = async () => {
  const response = await api.works.getAll();
  setWorks(response.data || []);
};

// Display images
<img src={work.imgUrl} alt={work.title} />;
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ All API Endpoints Working:

```bash
1. Abouts:  success: true, count: 3
2. Works:   success: true, count: 5
3. Skills:  success: true, count: 18
4. Awards:  success: true, count: 30
```

### ✅ No Sanity References Found:

```bash
grep -r "sanity|@sanity|client\.fetch|urlFor" src/**/*.{js,jsx}
# Result: No matches found ✓
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth:** All data now in MySQL database
2. **No External Dependencies:** No reliance on Sanity.io service
3. **Full Control:** Complete ownership of data and API

## Next Steps (If About Section Still Not Loading)

If the About section still shows "Failed to fetch" after deployment:

1. **Hard Refresh Browser:**

   ```
   Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**

   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Right-click → "Clear browser cache"

3. **Check Browser Console:**

   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any errors

4. **Verify Build Cache:**

   ```bash
   # Force Vercel rebuild
   vercel --prod --force
   ```

5. **Check API Directly:**
   ```bash
   curl https://www.ekdportfolio.ekddigital.com/api/abouts
   ```

## Support

If issues persist, check:

- Vercel deployment logs
- Browser console errors
- Network tab in DevTools
- API responses in Network tab

**Status:** All Sanity dependencies successfully removed! 🎉
