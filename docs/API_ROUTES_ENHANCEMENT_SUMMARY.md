## 🎯 Key Features Added to All Routes

### 1. **Advanced Filtering**

All GET / endpoints now support:

- `featured=true` - Get only featured items
- `category=<value>` - Filter by category
- `includeUnpublished=true` - Include unpublished items (admin)
- `includeDrafts=true` - Include draft items (admin)
- `sortBy=<field>` - Sort by any field
- `sortOrder=asc|desc` - Sort direction
- `featuredFirst=true` - Show featured items first (default)
- `limit=<number>` - Limit results (pagination)

### 2. **Content Management Endpoints**

Every route now has:

- `POST /:id/toggle-featured` - Toggle featured status
- `POST /:id/toggle-published` - Toggle published status
- `DELETE /:id` - Soft delete (archive)
- `POST /:id/restore` - Restore archived items

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### **QueryBuilder Utility**

Located: `backend_api/utils/queryBuilder.js`

**Functions:**

1. `buildWhereClause(options)` - Build Prisma where clause
2. `buildOrderBy(sortBy, sortOrder, featuredFirst)` - Build order clause
3. `parseQueryParams(query)` - Parse Express req.query
4. `parseJsonFields(item, jsonFields)` - Parse JSON strings to objects
5. `serializeJsonFields(data, jsonFields)` - Serialize objects to JSON
6. `incrementField(prisma, model, id, field)` - Increment numeric fields
7. `softDelete(prisma, model, id)` - Soft delete with deletedAt
8. `restoreDeleted(prisma, model, id)` - Restore soft-deleted items
9. `toggleFeatured(prisma, model, id)` - Toggle isFeatured
10. `togglePublished(prisma, model, id)` - Toggle isPublished
11. `updateDisplayOrder(prisma, model, items)` - Batch update displayOrder

### **Consistent Response Format**

All endpoints return:

```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "data": {...} or [...],
  "count": number,          // For list endpoints
  "message": string,        // For action endpoints
  "error": string,          // On errors
  "filters": {...}          // Applied filters (for list endpoints)
}
```

### **Soft Delete Implementation**

- All models have `deletedAt` DateTime field
- `DELETE /:id` sets `deletedAt` to current timestamp
- Items with `deletedAt !== null` excluded from queries by default
- `POST /:id/restore` sets `deletedAt` back to null

### **Featured First Ordering**

Default ordering for all list endpoints:

1. Featured items first (if `featuredFirst=true`, which is default)
2. Then by specified `sortBy` field
3. In specified `sortOrder` direction

Example Prisma query:

```javascript
orderBy: [
  { isFeatured: "desc" }, // Featured first
  { displayOrder: "asc" }, // Then by display order
];
```

## 📈 Statistics Endpoints Summary

Each route's `/stats/overview` returns relevant metrics:

| Route          | Key Metrics                                                              |

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### **Authentication Needed**

Currently, all routes are open. For production:

**Admin Endpoints (Require Auth):**

- All POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations
- Toggle endpoints (featured, published)
- Restore endpoints
- Reorder endpoints
- Statistics endpoints
- Upload endpoints

**Public Endpoints (No Auth):**

- `GET /` with filtering (only published items)
- `GET /:id` (only published items)
- `POST /` on Contact route (contact form submission)
- `GET /active/current` on Resume route

### **Recommended Middleware**

```javascript
const authMiddleware = require('../middleware/auth');

// Protect admin routes
router.post('/', authMiddleware, ...);
router.put('/:id', authMiddleware, ...);
router.delete('/:id', authMiddleware, ...);

// Keep public for viewing
router.get('/', ...);  // Only return published items by default
router.get('/:id', ...);
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Next Steps

### 1. **Update API Client** (`src/api/client.js`)

Add functions for all new endpoints:

```javascript
// Example for Work API
export const workApi = {
  getAll: (filters) => axios.get("/api/works", { params: filters }),
  getOne: (id, incrementViews) =>
    axios.get(`/api/works/${id}`, { params: { incrementViews } }),
  create: (data) => axios.post("/api/works", data),
  update: (id, data) => axios.put(`/api/works/${id}`, data),
  delete: (id) => axios.delete(`/api/works/${id}`),
  restore: (id) => axios.post(`/api/works/${id}/restore`),
  toggleFeatured: (id) => axios.post(`/api/works/${id}/toggle-featured`),
  togglePublished: (id) => axios.post(`/api/works/${id}/toggle-published`),
  like: (id) => axios.post(`/api/works/${id}/like`),
  reorder: (items) => axios.post("/api/works/reorder", { items }),
  getStats: () => axios.get("/api/works/stats/overview"),
};

// Repeat for all routes...
```

### 2. **Create Dashboard Manager Components**

For each model, create a manager with:

- List view with filters
- Toggle buttons for featured/published
- Drag-and-drop reordering (using display order)
- Archive/restore functionality
- Statistics dashboard
- Create/edit forms

### 3. **Update Frontend Components**

**Existing Components to Update:**

- `src/container/OrcidWorks/` - Integrate with new `/api/research/publications`
- `src/container/Work/` - Use new filtering
- `src/container/About/` - Use section types
- `src/container/Skills/` - Use category filtering
- `src/container/Awards/` - Use timeline view
- `src/pages/Contact/` - Use new contact endpoints

**New Components to Create:**

- `src/container/Research/` - Research statement section
- `src/container/Testimonials/` - Testimonials section
- `src/container/Leadership/` - Leadership/entrepreneurship section
- `src/pages/Dashboard/ResearchManager/` - Manage research & publications
- `src/pages/Dashboard/TestimonialManager/` - Manage testimonials
- `src/pages/Dashboard/LeadershipManager/` - Manage leadership items

### 4. **Integrate with Existing ORC ID**

The frontend already has ORCID integration in `OrcidWorks.jsx`:

```javascript
const orcidId = "0009-0005-5213-9834";
fetch(`https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/${orcidId}/works`);
```

**Recommended Integration:**

```javascript
// Fetch both ORCID and manual publications
const [orcidPubs, manualPubs] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(`https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/${orcidId}/works`),
  workApi.research.publications.getAll({ featured: true }),
]);

// Merge and deduplicate by DOI
const allPublications = mergePublications(orcidPubs, manualPubs);

// Display unified list
setPublications(allPublications);
```

## 📝 Database Migration Notes

### **Schema Changes**

All schema changes are already in place in `backend_api/prisma/schema.prisma`

### **Indexes Added**

For performance optimization, indexes were added for:

- `[isPublished, isFeatured, displayOrder]` - Common query pattern
- `[category]` - Category filtering
- `[deletedAt]` - Soft delete queries
- `[year]` - Year filtering (Experience, Award)
- `[createdAt]` - Chronological sorting

### **Migration Command**

If schema changes were made:

```bash
cd backend_api
npx prisma migrate dev --name enhanced_routes
npx prisma generate
```
